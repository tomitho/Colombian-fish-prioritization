# Integrating freshwater fish biodiversity into area-based prioritization in Colombia reveals a high protection gap

## Abstract
Colombia forms one of the global freshwater fish biodiversity hotspots, home to 1616 freshwater fish species. Given the increasing anthropogenic pressures on freshwater biodiversity, one relevant conservation question is, how well is fish fauna also represented within the protected areas of Colombia? To find an answer, we employ species distribution and spatial prioritization modelling to estimate (i) how the Colombian fish fauna is covered by the existing protected areas, and (ii) to which degree alternative protected area schemes  may have the potential to increase the number of fish species under protection. We constructed a database of 238,278 geographic occurrences of 1313 freshwater fishes across Colombia and neighboring countries, harmonized the nomenclature and revised the geo-referenced coordinates. Using the GMTED-digital elevation model, we delineated a stream network and extracted the corresponding 38150 sub-catchments that served as spatial units for the analyses. We then used an ensemble of algorithms to project single fish geographic distributions across the study area. We finally used integer linear programming to account for 30 % of each fishâ€™ suitable habitat for delineating a hypothetical priority area network. We found that this hypothetical network overlaps only by 25.2 % with the existing protected area network. Moreover, we found that endemic and threatened species, especially in the Magdalena-Cauca and Pacific-Choco basins contributed towards new areas that would be integral for an efficient freshwater fish protection. Overall, our results highlight the discrepancy between freshwater biodiversity conservation and protected areas in Colombia and guide the potential integration of new areas for freshwater conservation in places of high ecological value and reduced anthropogenic impact.

## Project code
This repository contains the code used in the puplication "Integrating freshwater fish biodiversity into area-based prioritization in Colombia reveals a high protection gap" (future URL link:). The code is split in the following working steps descriped in detail in the method section. 
1. Data preperation
2. Ensemble species distribution modelling
3. Spatial prioritization
